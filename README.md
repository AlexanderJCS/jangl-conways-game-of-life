# jangl-conways-game-of-life
Conway's Game of Life using the graphics library I made, [JANGL](https://github.com/AlexanderJCS/JANGL).

## Compiling

In your IDE, make sure to set the libraries path to `/libs` (guide for IntelliJ [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-module-dependencies.html)).

If you receive an error about not starting on the first thread, make sure to add the following to your VM arguments:
```
-XstartOnFirstThread
```
This will need to be done on most macOS systems.
